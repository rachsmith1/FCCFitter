   :target: https://gitlab.cern.ch/TRExStats/TRExFitter/commits/master


Getting the code
---------
To get the code, use the following command::

  git clone ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/TRExStats/TRExFitter.git

To get a specific tag, do the following::

  cd TRExFitter && git checkout <tag number> && cd -

Setup
---------
To setup just use the script::

  source setup.sh

(should work on any machine with access to afs - provided that nothing else is set-up previously)

To compile::

  make

(this will take as main code the file util/myFit.C)

or specify a custom main file as argument::

  make  util/myNewCustomFit.C


How to
---------
To run the code, after compiling (see "Setup"), use the command::

    ./myFit.exe  <action(s)>  [<config file>]  [<update>]  [<options>]

The configuration file (<config file>) is a text file containing all the information on the definition of samples and fit regions, including all the fit and draw options.
By default the file  config/myFit.config  is loaded.
See the section "Config File" for more details.
As examples give a look at  ``config/myFit.config``  or  ``config/ttH2015.config`` .
Most of the times the only file the user has to modify to get his fit is the configuration file.

The only mandatory argument, <action(s)>, tells to the TtHFitter which operation(s) to perform.
The possible operations are defined in the main file (e.g. util/myFit.C).
For instance, if you use the default file `util/myFit.C`, the available options are:

* h : read input histograms (valid only if the proper option is spefified in the config file)
* n : read input ntuples (valid only if the proper option is spefified in the config file)
* w : create the RooStats xmls and workspace
* f : fit the workspace
* l : calculate exclusion limit
* s : calculate significance
* d : draw pre-fit plots
* p : draw post-fit plots
* a : draw separation plots
* r : draw ranking plot (see later)
* b : re-run smoothing (in the future also rebinning)
* m : multi-fit (see later)

New optional argument: <options>.
It's a string (so make sure to use " or ' to enclose the string if you use more than one option) defining a list of options, in the form::

    "<option1>=<value1>,<value2>,...:<option2>=..."

See the section "Command line options" below.


Config File
---------

Here's a list of the inputs and options which can be specifed in the config file:

- The structure of the file should be the following::

     <ObjectType>: <ObjectName>
       <ObjectProperty>: <Value>
       <ObjectProperty>: <Value>
       ...

     <ObjectType>: <ObjectName>
       <ObjectProperty>: <Value>
       <ObjectProperty>: <Value>
       ...

     ...

NB: note the *blank* line between the objects!!)

- The file should contain
   * exactly one object of type "Fit"
   * at least one object of type "Sample"
   * at least one object of type "Region"
   * any number of objects of type "Systematic" (even 0 should be ok)

Note that, each object should have unique <ObjectName>.


- Then, for each object type, here's a PARTIAL list of properties to be specified:

  * Job:
     * Label: it's the label which will be showed on the plots
     * POI: the name of the parameter of interest; this should correspond to a NormFactor defined below
     * ReadFrom         : can be HIST or NTUP; default is HIST

     * SystPruningShape : Lower threshold to remove a shape systematic from the fit/limit (suppression is done per sample and per region) (Ex: 0.02 for 2%)
     * SystPruningNorm  : Lower threshold to remove a normalisation systematic from the fit/limit (suppression is done per sample and per region) (Ex: 0.02 for 2%)
     * SystLarge        : all systematics above this threshold will be flagged in the pruning plot) (e.g. 0.4 will flag systematics that are larger than 40%)
     * IntCodeOverall   : interpolation code used for the normalization component of systematics (should match the one used in RooStats)
     * IntCodeShape     : interpolation code used for the shape component of systematics (should match the one used in RooStats)

     * PlotOptions      : a set of options for plotting:
        * YIELDS : if set, the legend will be one-column and will include the yileds; otherwise two-columns and no yields

If the option is set to "fillUpFrame" data will also be plotted in the upper frame.
     * CorrelationThreshold : Threshold used to draw the correaltion matrix (only systematics with at least one correlation larger than than draw) (0.05:5%)
     * SignalRegionsPlot: list of regions to put in SignalRegionsPlot; use "EMPTY" to put an empty entry, "ENDL" to specify end of line
     * HistoChecks      : NOCRASH: means that if an error is found in the input histograms, the code continues (with only warnings) -- default leads to a crash in case of problem

     * NumCPU           : specify the number of CPU to use for the minimization (default = 1)
     * StatOnlyFit      : if specified, the fit will keep fixed all the NP to the latest fit result, and the fit results will be saved with the _statOnly suffix (also possible to use it from command line)

Command line options
---------

Currently the supported options are:

* Regions:     to limit the regions to use to the list specified
* Samples:     to limit the samples to use to the list specified
* Systematics: to limit the systematics to use to the list specified
* Signal:      in case more than one SIGNAL sample is specified in your config file, you can specify which one you want to run on (for plots, workspace creation and fits/limits/significance)
* Exclude:     to exclude certain Regions / Samples / Systematics
* Suffix:      used for: plots, workspace, fit resutls, etc
* Update:      if TRUE, the output .root file is updated, otherwise is overwrote
* StatOnlyFit: if TRUE, the same as Fit->StatOnlyFit

Note: the wild-card * is supported, but only as last character.
Example::

     ./myFit.exe  n  config/ttH2015.config 'Regions=HThad_ge6jge4b:Exclude=BTag_*'


Ranking Plot
---------

- The ranking plot can be created in one go, with just the command line argument "r" (after having run the nominal fit fit "f").
- Since this can take too much time (and memory), for complicated fits it's better to run it in several steps:
   by specifying the command-line option "Ranking=<name/index>", one can produce the txt input for the ranking only for a specific line of the ranking, i.e. for a single NP (speficied either through its name or index). Once all the needed txt files are created (e.g. in parallel through batch jobs) with the option "Ranking=plot" they are merged to create the final plot.

- Examples::

     # this runs the ranking in one go
     ./myFit.exe  r  <config>
     #these commands will first create the inputs for the ranking one by one and then merge them in the plot
     ./myFit.exe  r  <config> Ranking=Lumi
     ./myFit.exe  r  <config> Ranking=JES1
     ./myFit.exe  r  <config> Ranking=ttXsec
     ./myFit.exe  r  <config> Ranking=plot


Multi-Fit
---------

The Multi-Fit functionality can be used to compare fit results or even to combine fit inputs from different configuration files / Jobs.

- To use it you need a dedicated config file, with a similar structure as the usual ones. Example::

    MultiFit: "myTopWS_multifit"
      Label: "My Label"
      Combine: FALSE
      Compare: TRUE
      CmeLabel: "13 TeV"
      LumiLabel: "85 pb^{-1}"
      ComparePOI: TRUE
      ComparePulls: TRUE
      CompareLimits: TRUE
      POIName: "SigXsecOverSM"
      POIRange: -10,30
      DataName: "obsData"
      CombineChByCh: TRUE

    Fit: "CR"
      ConfigFile: config/myTopWS_CR.config
      Label: "CR-only"

    Fit: "SR"
      ConfigFile: config/myTopWS_SR.config
      Label: "SR"

- This config file can be run with the command line::

    ./myFit  m  config/myTopWS_multifit.config

  this will compare the fit resutls in terms of fitted NP, fitted POI and limits from the two config files specified. Notice that the fit and limits results have to be already available (they are not produced on the flight).

- To make a real combination, one needs to use the usual command options "w", "f" and "l" together with the flag "Combine: TRUE" in the config above. Example::

    ./myFit  mwf  config/myTopWS_multifit.config

  this will create a combined ws starting from the individual ws for the different regions in the two config files, and fit it.


Output Directories Structure
---------

* For each TtHFit objetc, a diretory is created, with the same name as the Fit Name
* Inside this direcotry, at every step, some outputs are created, following the structure described above

  * Plots/              : contains the data/MC plots, pre- and post-fit, for all the Signal, Control and Validation regions, including the summary plots
  * Tables/             : contains the tables in txt and tex format
  * RooStats/           : contains the workspace(s) and the xmls
  * Fits/               : contains the output from fits
  * Limits/             : contains the outputs from the limit-setting code
  * Significance/       : contains the outputs from the significance code
  * Systematics/        : contains the plots for the syst variations
  * Histograms/         : contains the root file(s) with all the inputs
  * LHoodPlots/         : contains the likelihood scan with respect to the specified parameter
